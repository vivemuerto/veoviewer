This is a Java application which serves as an interface to the Veo Observer netcam.  It is based on the excellent groundwork done by J.R. (http://www.halo3.net/projects/veo/).  I tried to contact him to get his permission to use his code, but got no response.  I'm assuming that since he posted the source code on the web that he wouldn't mind. ;-)

The current functionality includes viewing any of the 3 supported streams, moving the camera, and functioning as an image server for the web.  Many enhancements are planned, but as the company that makes this camera appears to be out of business, there may not be much need.  I only have one of the cameras, and if it breaks I will probably discontinue work on this project!
